# 👋 Hi, I'm Neeru!

I'm a full-time mom of twins and an aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer, currently focused on Frontend Development with React.
After taking a career break to raise my children, I made a bold decision to return to tech.

I'm currently learning the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) through self-study, projects, and endless cups of coffee ☕.

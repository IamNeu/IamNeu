# 👋 Hi, I'm Neeru!

I'm a full-time mom of twins and an aspiring full-stack web developer.  
After taking a career break to raise my children, I made a bold decision to return in tech.

I'm currently learning the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) through self-study, projects, and endless cups of coffee ☕.

- HTML5, CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)

### 🧩 Projects I'm Building
- 📝 To-Do App (React)
- 📚 Recipe Book (MongoDB + Express)

### 🎯 Goals for 2025
